Project inspired and done following the Lama Dev tutorial.

Main goal of the project is to create fullstack e-commerce application and learn new tools used in commercial programing. 
To build the frontend I used React and styled components. Backend is handled by Node JS framework - express. To store data I used Mongo DB. 
Project uses JWT to authenticate users.
